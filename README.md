# Kiddopaint ❖ https://kiddopaint.com/

Dr Halo, Kid Pix, MacPaint, & MS Paint were some of my earliest intros to computers—less so on the artistic parts, but more so on the "what does this button do?" and getting mastery around the keyboard and mouse. Inspired by those early drawing apps, I made this for my kids. If you have kids in your life, I'd love your feedback!

Kiddopaint was meant to be used without having to consult a user guide, so, dig in! There are a handful of hidden features behind various modifier keys (⌘, ⌥, ⇧) for some of the tools. Enjoy! :)
